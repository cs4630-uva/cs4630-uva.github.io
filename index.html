Participants will delve into the ethical considerations tied to computer security breaches, grasp the intricacies of software vulnerabilities, and discern how adversaries exploit them. The curriculum offers insights into a plethora of malware types, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans, as well as other attacks encompassing social engineering, phishing, and denial of service. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in the methods to prevent, detect, and repair malware threats and will have hands-on experience with program binary examination tools to identify malicious code.</p> <hr> <h3 id="instructor">Instructor</h3> <div class="row row-cols-2 projects pt-3 pb-3"> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hur7wv/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"> <div class="card-img col-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/team/wajih.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Wajih Ul Hassan" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-7"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-left">Wajih Ul Hassan</h5> <p class="card-text text-left">hassan@virginia.edu</p> <p class="card-text text-left">Rice Hall 522</p> <p class="card-text text-left">Office Hours: Wednesdays 11AM-Noon</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> </div> <hr> <h3 id="teaching-assistants">Teaching Assistants</h3> <div class="row row-cols-2 projects pt-3 pb-3"> <div class="card-item col"> <a href=""> <div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"> <div class="card-img col-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/team/arnab.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Arnabjyoti (Arnab) Kalita" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-7"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-left">Arnabjyoti (Arnab) Kalita</h5> <p class="card-text text-left">mje6jj@virginia.edu</p> <p class="card-text text-left"></p> <p class="card-text text-left">Office Hours: Mondays 11am - 12:30pm </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href=""> <div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"> <div class="card-img col-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/team/anne.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Anne Zhang" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-7"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-left">Anne Zhang</h5> <p class="card-text text-left">txd5dg@virginia.edu</p> <p class="card-text text-left"></p> <p class="card-text text-left">Office Hours: Tuesdays 2pm-3pm</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href=""> <div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"> <div class="card-img col-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/team/di.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Di Zhu" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-7"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-left">Di Zhu</h5> <p class="card-text text-left">yqx8es@virginia.edu</p> <p class="card-text text-left"></p> <p class="card-text text-left">Office Hours: Mondays 3:30pm-5pm</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> </div> <hr> <h3 id="lectures">Lectures</h3> <p>TuTh 5:00PM-6:15PM, Room: Olsson Hall 005</p> <hr> <h3 id="required-text-book">Required Text Book</h3> <p>None.</p> <hr> <h3 id="communications">Communications</h3> <ul> <li>I am committed to supporting your learning experience, which is why I will be recording lectures and making them available on Canvas.

If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu">cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the <a href="http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SDAC website</a>: <em>sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</em>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p> <p><strong>Religious Accommodations</strong> It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p> <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights</a> (EOCR) at <em>UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</em> or 434-924-3200.</p> <p><strong>Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence</strong> The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students.

As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.</p> <p><strong>Support for your career development</strong> Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations. &lt;/details&gt;</p> <p><strong>Community and Identity</strong> The <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Diversity in Engineering</a> (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world. The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.</p> <p><strong>Ethics Statement</strong> This course includes topics related to computer security and privacy.
