### Course Objectives

This course aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted realm of computer security. Participants will delve into the ethical considerations tied to computer security breaches, grasp the intricacies of software vulnerabilities, and discern how adversaries exploit them. The curriculum offers insights into a plethora of malware types, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans, as well as other attacks encompassing social engineering, phishing, and denial of service. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in the methods to prevent, detect, and repair malware threats and will have hands-on experience with program binary examination tools to identify malicious code.

### Policies and Statements
<details>
  <summary>Academic Integrity</summary>

  Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud (http://honor.virginia.edu/ academic-fraud).

  * Students are encouraged to discuss programs in general and to help one another find bugs in existing programs. However, using another's code or writing code for someone else is cheating and a violation of the University's Honor System. This includes consulting solutions to assignments from previous years or tests from previous years. Keep code listings to provide evidence of your creative development.

  * Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. This means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are also not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student's exam papers while working on an exam.

  * Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).
  Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee, if appropriate.

  If you have questions on what is allowable, please ask!

  <summary>Students with disabilities or learning needs (_click to expand_)</summary>

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the [SDAC website](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/): _sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu_. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

  <summary>Religious Accommodations (_click to expand_)</summary>

It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the [University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) (EOCR) at _UVAEOCR@virginia.edu_ or 434-924-3200.

  <summary> Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence (_click to expand_)</summary>

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available - [_www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence_](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence).

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior.

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](https://justreportit.virginia.edu/) (justreportit.virginia.edu) or [contact EOCR](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu), the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services ("CAPS")](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) and [Women's Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates ](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/counseling/our-counseling-services)(for students of all genders).

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.

  <summary> Support for your career development (_click to expand_)</summary>
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

  <summary> Community and Identity (_click to expand_)</summary>
The [Center for Diversity in Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering) (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world.  The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.
